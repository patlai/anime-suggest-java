# Anime Suggestion Engine

This is a java application made by Patrick Lai and Yu-Yueh Liu (@uace) at McGill CodeJam 2016.
This app takes a list of anime that the user has watched and outputs a list of suggested animes for them in a java swing UI. This was built using MyAnimeList's API and the OpenNLP Library. Currently the app is not optimized so the suggestion algorithm takes a while to run, especially for lists of many animes.
